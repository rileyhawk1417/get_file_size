# Description

This is my first rust program. Not exactly the correct way to learn Rust, I tend to work better if am building something.
The tool mainly compares the file size between any two given files.
For usage something like: `./get_file_size file_a.zip file_b.zip`

So it's not polished or perfect so to say but for now it gets the job done.
